# Theory
Compilation is the process of turning C language source code into machine code. Because C is a mid-level language, a compiler is required to turn it into executable code that can run on our machine. A C programme is transformed into an executable by a compiler. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.
