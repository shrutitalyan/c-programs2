# C- Programming Basics

# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process
# Theory
Compilation is the process of turning C language source code into machine code. Because C is a mid-level language, a compiler is required to turn it into executable code that can run on our machine. A C programme is transformed into an executable by a compiler. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.

# C- Programming Basics - Lab 2 (23/08/23)
# Q1) Write a program to print sizes of different data types
# Theory 
The size of a data type is the size it takes in memory. Their sizes vary. This size is represented in bytes. We can use the sizeof() method to get their sizes.

# Q2) Write a C program to read a number from the user and print a table of multiplication for that number.
# Theory
The program below takes an integer input from the user and generates the multiplication tables

# Q3) Write a program to display different start patterns on screen.
# Theory 
We must use two or three loops to create a star pattern in the C language. The number of loops depends on the pattern that we need to create. For pattern, a minimum of two is used i.e. one for a row and one for a column. The First loop is called an outer loop that shows the rows, and the second loop is called an inner loop that shows columns.
