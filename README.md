# C- Programming Basics
# Lab 1 (22/08/2023)
# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process
# Theory
Compilation is the process of turning C language source code into machine code. Because C is a mid-level language, a compiler is required to turn it into executable code that can run on our machine. A C programme is transformed into an executable by a compiler. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.

# C- Programming Basics - Lab 2 (23/08/23)
# Q1) Write a program to print sizes of different data types
# Theory 
The size of a data type is the size it takes in memory. Their sizes vary. This size is represented in bytes. We can use the sizeof() method to get their sizes.

# Q2) Write a C program to read a number from the user and print a table of multiplication for that number.
# Theory
The program below takes an integer input from the user and generates the multiplication tables

# Q3) Write a program to display different start patterns on screen.
# Theory 
We must use two or three loops to create a star pattern in the C language. The number of loops depends on the pattern that we need to create. For pattern, a minimum of two is used i.e. one for a row and one for a column. The First loop is called an outer loop that shows the rows, and the second loop is called an inner loop that shows columns.

# C-Programming Basics - Lab 3 (29/08/2023)
# Q1) Write a program to demonstrate pointers. Declare a pointer ptr to integer and equate it to the address of integer i. Print value of i, value of &i, value of ptr and value of *ptr.
# Theory
The use of pointers allows low-level memory access, dynamic memory allocation, and many other functionality in C.
A pointer is defined as a derived data type that can store the address of other C variables or a memory location. We can access and manipulate the data stored in that memory location using pointers.T he syntax of pointers is similar to the variable declaration in C, but we use the ( * ) dereferencing operator in the pointer declaration.

datatype * ptr;
# Output

# Q2) Write a program in C to demonstrate function call by value and call by reference by writing a swap function to swap two integers.
# Theory
The methods of passing arguments to a function in C can be divided into two categories: "call by value" and "call by reference." These methods ascertain the impact of changing function parameter values on the initial values outside the function.

# C- Programming Basics - Lab 5 (11/09/23)

# Q1) Write a program to demonstrate Recursion
# Theory 
Recursion in C is a programming technique that allows a function to call itself. This can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

# (1) Addition of first n integers

# (2) Factorial of n

# C- Programming Basics - Lab 6 (14/09/23) - (18/09/23)
# Q1) Write a program to demonstrate arrays and strings.
# Theory 
Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures in C programming. They are used to store collections of data of the same type.
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in an array is identified by an index, which is an integer value starting from 0.
A string is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character (\0). Strings are commonly used to represent text data. In C, strings are essentially one-dimensional character arrays.
# Q1) Aim : Print five digit number in words.
