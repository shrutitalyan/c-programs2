# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process
# Theory
Compilation is the process of turning C language source code into machine code. Because C is a mid-level language, a compiler is required to turn it into executable code that can run on our machine. A C programme is transformed into an executable by a compiler. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.

# Q1) Write a program to print sizes of different data types
# Theory 
The size of a data type is the size it takes in memory. Their sizes vary. This size is represented in bytes. We can use the sizeof() method to get their sizes.
